Solunar theory is a hypothesis that patterns of animal movement are governed by the relative position of the sun and moon. The theory predicts peak activity on the approach of the new and full moon. It also predicts daily major periods of animal activity at lunar noon and lunar midnight, and intermediate minor periods at moonrise and moonset, with heigtened activity whenever these solunar periods coincide with sunrise or sunset.

This app displays sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, lunar noon, lunar midnight, phase, and illumination of the moon. It makes a daily prediction (average, good, better, best) and identifies periods of activity that coincide with sunrise and sunset.
